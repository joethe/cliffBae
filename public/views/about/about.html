        <br><br>
	    <p>This is a game that we created at <a href="https://carlhacks.com/">CarlHacks 2016</a>, a Hackathon hosted by the Carleton college. Teams are given 36 hours to create a project of their choice, and make it happen.</p>

        <p>Our project is to recreate a board game called Fjords which some of the members of our group are a great fan of, but is now (sadly) out of print. Fjords is a 2-player strategy game where players place terrain tiles and create a unique board, before creating farms to claim their territory and fend off the enemy farmer.</p>

        <h2>Who are we?</h2>

        <p>Joe Thelen: Some guy who is probably on lots of lists.</p>
        <p>Henry Fellows: He spends way too much money at Axman on weird electronics that are probably going to kill someone. Or at least burn the building down.</p>
        <p>Sean Stockholm: Never on task, he's probably off doing something he enjoys as opposed to the task at hand. Sean also loves doing things in the most complicated (read: fun) way possible, for reasons unknown.</p>
        <p>Jack Ziegler: The guy writing these bios, and doing little else of practical use.</p>
