<h2>How to play our game.</h2>
<p>You may be wondering how to play our game. Too bad! We were too lazy to tell you!</p>

<p>On a serious note though, the rules of the game are pretty simple. There are two stages of the game. The terrain stage, and the territory stage.</p>

<br>

<h3>The Terrain Stage:</h3>
<p>The first part of the game is the Terrain Stage. During this part, players
    take turns pulling a landscape tile from the pool. If they are able to do so,
    they place the tile as an addition to the existing terrain. The rules for
    placement are as follows. Firstly, the newly placed tile must share two
    sides with existing terrain pieces. Yes Jeffrey, that means you can't build
    a one-wide bridge to Hawaii, much as you might like to.</p>
